# QOR overview

[QOR](https://github.com/qor/qor) is a set of libraries written in Go that abstract common features needed for business applications, Content Management Systems (CMS), and E-commerce systems (EC).

Typically, a [QOR](https://github.com/qor/qor)-based system will revolve around [QOR Admin](/admin/README.md), which is the CMS component. [QOR Admin](/admin/README.md) facilitates easy database and media content management and is not bound to a single database technology.

The bulk of QOR's multifaceted capabilities lie in the plugins, they can be used independently but their super-powers shine when used together. Many of the plugins utilize [GORM](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm) as ORM.
